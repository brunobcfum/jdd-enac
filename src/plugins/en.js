      description: 'Aeronautics is a complex human-machine hybrid system, which puts into action many heterogeneous subsystems. In this framework, the objectives of the IIT TEAM are to better understand the phenomena of interaction and to master the design of better performing interactive systems.',
      hmi: 'Human-Machine Interaction » (HMI) carries out research aiming to improve the quality and performance of visualisations and interactions at the heart of the human-machine hybrid system. It notably involves designing robust interactions at the heart of cyber-human systems which will not collapse in non-nominal operational situations and where the frontier between humans and technology is diminishing to the point where technology is becoming a natural extension of the human.',
      ise: 'Interactive System Engineering » (ISE) carries out research aiming to improve the design of interactive systems by the development of useable conceptual tools (models, theories) and concrete tools (programming languages, editing). Their novel approach consists in reforging the principles of programming with a unified model of interactive systems, based on the concept of coupling between processes.'

      description: 'The work of the DEVI team is centred on aeronautical data and addresses the statistical analysis, visualisation, elaboration, and estimation of economic models. This interdisciplinary team draws on three scientific fields which are: applied mathematics, data visualisation, and economics. It is strengthened by the support of an IT engineer and the manager of a database containing information about airline companies, airports, and air traffic from country to country and city to city.',
      statistics: 'STATISTICS is devoted to new methods of data analysis such as: statistical analysis of plane trajectories, the adaptation of algorithms allocated to aeronautical data, the study of large graphs. The use of information geometry to analyse the structure of plane trajectories is a novel and promising activity, with the principle application being the detection of atypical flights.',
      air_economics: 'AIR TRANSPORT ECONOMICS positions itself as a European reference pertaining to subjects such as: the study of airline companies and their strategies for market entry, the analysis of interventions on behalf of the authorities and their impact, the modelisation of the behaviour of stakeholders (consumers, producers, regulators, aeronautical facilities). In particular, the analysis of the impact of new communication technology (ICT) on the behaviour of air travellers, done through the notion of “time value”, is part of the research concerning all modes of transportation.',
      visualization: 'DATA VISUALISATION explores the visualisation and interaction methods for large quantites of data. Many algorithms exploit this data automatically, thus limiting the ability of users to evaluate the quality of the obtained results. The approach explored by DEVI seeks to reinstate the human at the heart of the system; the computer resources are used for their power to calculate and display, whereas the extraction of knowledge and decision making remain human.'

    optim: {
      description: 'The Optim team is involved with upstream optimisation research and with the modelisation and resolution of novel optimisation problems emanating mainly from aeronautics. The algorithms developed by the Optim team integrate professional knowledge and utilise a large diversity of structures, models and mathematical methods. Modern computing techniques are mobilised to solve examples of problems on a very large scale.',
      axis: 'The goal of the Optim team is, on one hand, the resolution of problems in the aeronautical world through the use of techniques which rely on optimisation, machine learning or optimal control, and on the other hand, carrying out fundamental research which can help to supply useful basic theories for resolving the aforementioned problems. The members of the team are very knowledgeable in mathematical modelisation of combined, continued, and mixed optimisation problems. The approaches mastered by the team include methods of deterministic global optimization, stochastic optimization, metaheuristics for large scale problems and their hybridisation, machine learning, constraint programming, and the development of tools for decision making. Optimisation in function spaces is a specialty of the team.'
